MPU6050 AVR Interface
Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface the MPU6050, a popular 6-axis gyro and accelerometer, with an AVR microcontroller using C programming. The MPU6050 communicates with the AVR through the I2C protocol, and this project provides all necessary code to read the sensor data.

Features
I2C Communication: Setup and examples of I2C communication between the MPU6050 and AVR.
Data Processing: Functions to process and interpret the gyroscope and accelerometer data.
Modular Code: Easy to integrate with other projects and systems.
Hardware Requirements
Any AVR microcontroller with I2C support (e.g., ATmega328P)
MPU6050 sensor module
Breadboard and connecting wires
Optional: LED indicators for debugging
Software Requirements
AVR-GCC compiler
AVRDUDE for programming
Optional: Atmel Studio or similar IDE for development
Wiring Setup
Describe how to connect the MPU6050 to the AVR microcontroller:

rust
Copy code
MPU6050 -> AVR Microcontroller
VCC -> 5V
GND -> Ground
SCL -> SCL (Check microcontroller datasheet for pin)
SDA -> SDA (Check microcontroller datasheet for pin)
INT -> Any available digital I/O (optional)


Code Explanation
main.c: Initializes the system and contains the main loop.
i2c.c: Contains the I2C communication functions.
mpu6050.c: Functions specific to interfacing with the MPU6050.
Example Output
Describe what the user should see if everything is working correctly, such as serial console output, LED blinking patterns, etc.
